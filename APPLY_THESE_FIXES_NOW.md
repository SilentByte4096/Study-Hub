# Apply These Database Fixes NOW

You still have database errors because the user profile creation isn't working properly. Here's what you need to do:

## Step 1: Run Additional Database Fixes

Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor and run the contents of:
`supabase/migrations/20250902_additional_fixes.sql`

This will:
1. Create profiles for existing users who don't have them
2. Add robust profile creation functions
3. Fix foreign key constraint issues

## Step 2: Quick Manual Fix (Alternative)

If you want to fix it immediately, run this single SQL command in Supabase:

```sql
-- Create profile for your current user
INSERT INTO profiles (id, full_name, email, role)
SELECT 
    au.id,
    COALESCE(au.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', 'User') as full_name,
    au.email,
    'student' as role
FROM auth.users au
WHERE au.id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM profiles)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

## Step 3: Check CORS Settings

The CORS error indicates your Supabase project may not be configured properly:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
2. Make sure your project URL and anon key are correctly set in your `js/config.js`
3. Check that CORS is enabled for `http://localhost:3000`

## Step 4: Test the Application

After running the database fixes:

1. Refresh your browser (F5)
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check if the dashboard loads without errors
4. Try creating a flashcard set

## Expected Result

After applying these fixes, you should see:
- ✅ User profile loads correctly
- ✅ Dashboard data displays without errors
- ✅ Flashcard creation works
- ✅ No more foreign key constraint violations

## If Still Having Issues

If you continue to see errors:

1. Check the browser console for the specific error messages
2. Verify the database fixes were applied by going to Supabase → Table Editor → profiles and confirming your user profile exists
3. Make sure your Supabase project is active and not paused

The CORS error suggests there might be a connectivity issue with your Supabase project. Double-check your project URL and keys in the configuration.
